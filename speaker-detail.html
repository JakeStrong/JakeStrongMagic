                    	<p>Ever since I was old enough to speak, I’ve been obsessed with magic. Recently, I’ve taken my obsession to the next level and have made a career out of my hobby. Since then, I have been fortunate enough to perform hundreds of shows all over the Tri-State area. In 2016, I was one of six “2016 Society of American Magicians Star of Tomorrow” in America. I have also lent my talents to charity including the Ronald McDonald house, many schools, and a self-made successful fundraiser raising money for a family in need. My magic is best described as dazzling magic full with many laughs. To contact me for your event, you can click the contact tab or call me at (609)-975-8074.</p>
